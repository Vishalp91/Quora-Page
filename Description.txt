Hello there !

This file contains basic information about Quora page Project (RESTful APIs Implementation)
In this QuoraPage project i am going to develop a Quora Posts page using RESTful APIs

In this page the posts will be the resource which is basically an array of objects where each object is our individual Post
object => post => {id : someId, username : someUsername, content : someContent}

Using Express.js we will handle client requests coming on the localhost port 8080 (Server on the same local machine) i.e i will write server side code using Express.js
(Index Route) GET request => "/posts" to server to display all posts on browser for which server will render "Home.ejs" file with posts
Note : "/posts" means it is basically an URL which client enters in browser i.e resuest to which server is sending a response 

(Show Route => show post button/anchor tag press) GET request => "/posts/:id" to server to display specific post with id in detail. Server will now respond with "Show.ejs" File with specific post data

(New Route => create new post button press) POST request => "/posts" to server to create new Post
    1. Server on reciving above request render "New.ejs" file(form) 
    2. On form submission push new post to posts array and redirect to "Home.ejs"

(Edit Route => Edit button press) PATCH request => "/posts/:id to server to edit specific post with id
    1. Server on reciving above request responds with "Edit.ejs" file(form)
    2. On form submit updates post(object) in posts array and redirects to "Home.ejs"

(Delete Route => Delete button press) DELETE request => "/posts/:id" to server then 
    server removes specific post from posts array using filter() method on posts array and 
    redirects to "Home.ejs"
